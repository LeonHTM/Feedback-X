Happens when swiping up to exit App Library. The Borders of the Blur are visible in the left and right bottom corner. This happens because the blur texture is too small.


Reproduce:
Go to App Library.
Swipe up to exit it.
Look at the bottom left corner of the iPhone.
Blur is missing in the corner.

Fix: Make the Blur Texture marginal Bigger

Expected Result:
Border of Blur should not be visible. Like in iOS 17
