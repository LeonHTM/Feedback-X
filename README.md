# Feedback-X
Programm to fil multiple Feedbacks in Apple Feedback Assistant of the same Bug at once.

## Prerequisite Part 1:  
You have to have multiple Apple Accounts for the Programm to make sense. I personally recommend at least 10 because of the "More than 10" Behavior, but you can also choose to have only 5. 

### How to create Multiple Apple Accounts (Former Apple IDs) with the same number and mail:

There are two ways: 

A: On the Web with optional steps on an Apple Device  
B: Entirely on an Apple Device    
Important: Its only possible to create 2 Apple Accounts with the same Phone Number per 24h. (2 Accs / 24h) Creating Accounts with the same number will therefore take time. Apple will measure the time exactly. Meaning if you created the second Account for a day at 7:54 AM you will only be able to create further Acounts at 7:54+ a day later. This limit exist in both Methods.

### A: Create Apple Accounts on the web:

For this Method to work you need an Apple Account with iCloud+ active. (Optionally an Apple Device)

A1: Create a Hide my Mail Adress (Settings> iCloud > Hide my Email)  
A2: Go to https://duckduckgo.com/email/ and create an realy for you Hide my mail Adress   
A3: Sign up on https://account.apple.com and use the duckduckgo mail relay mail ending on @duck.com and use your usual phone number (you can create infinite amount of Apple Accounts with the same phone number as long as you have different mails)  
A4: Optional (Skip to A7 if not intrested): Log in with this Apple Account on an Apple Device (There is no limit to log-ins)   
A5: Optional: Create iCloud mail adress in Settings > iCloud > Mail  
A6: Optional: Wait 31 Days to replace the @duck.com adress with the @icloud adress as the main adress of the account on https://account.apple.com <br>
A7: Sign up for the Apple Developer Programm on https://developer.apple.com  

### B: Create Apple Accounts on an Apple Device:

For this Method to work you need an Apple Device. There is a max of 3 Accounts you can create per Device. Meaning you will need 1/3 as much Devices as you want to create Apple Accounts.

B1: Make sure there is no iCloud logged into the Device  
B2: Head to Settings > iCloud > Password forgotten or no Apple Account > Create Apple Account  
B3: Create an Apple Account wiht an entirely new iCloud mail and your existing Phone Number  
B4: Sign up for the Apple Developer Programm on https://developer.apple.com
