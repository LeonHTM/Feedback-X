# Feedback X (still under active development)
Programm to multiply bug reports in Apple Feedback Assistant for them to get more attention.

## Prerequisite Part 1:  
You have to have multiple Apple Accounts for the Programm to make sense. I recommend at least 10, because of the "More than 10" behavior. However, you can also choose to have only 5. 

### How to create Multiple Apple Accounts (Former Apple IDs) with the same phone number and E-mail:

There are two ways:

A: On the Web with optional steps on an Apple Device  
B: Entirely on an Apple Device    
Important: It's only possible to create 2 Apple accounts with the same phone number in 24h (2 Accs / 24h). Creating accounts with the same number will therefore take time. Apple will measure the time exactly. Meaning, if you create the second account for a day at 7:54 AM, you will only be able to create further accounts at 7:54+ a day later. This limit exists in both methods.

### A: Create Apple accounts on the web:

For this method to work you need an Apple account with iCloud+ active. (Optionally an Apple device)

A1: Create a Hide my Mail address (Settings > iCloud > Hide my Email)  
A2: Go to https://duckduckgo.com/email/ and create an realy for you Hide my mail Adress   
A3: Sign up on https://account.apple.com and use the duckduckgo mail relay mail ending on @duck.com and use your usual phone number (you can create infinite amount of Apple accounts with the same phone number as long as you have different mails)  
A4: Optional: (Skip to A7 if not intrested): Log in with this Apple account on an Apple device. There is no limit to log-ins.   
A5: Optional: Create iCloud mail adress in Settings > iCloud > Mail  
A6: Optional: Wait 31 Days to replace the @duck.com adress with the @icloud adress as the main adress of the account on https://account.apple.com <br>
A7: Sign up for the Apple Developer Programm on https://developer.apple.com  

### B: Create Apple Accounts on an Apple Device:

For this Method to work you need an Apple device. There is a max of 3 accounts you can create per device. Meaning you will need 1/3 as much devices as you want to create Apple accounts.

B1: Make sure there is no iCloud logged into the device  
B2: Head to Settings > iCloud > Password forgotten or no Apple Account > Create Apple Account  
B3: Create an Apple account wiht an entirely new iCloud mail and your existing phone number  
B4: Sign up for the Apple Developer Programm on https://developer.apple.com
